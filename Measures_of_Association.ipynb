    "Kiana is a new member of the afterschool program that Ethan and Diego are involved in. They all shared their ideas for solving the traffic and pollution problems. Diego has been collecting different types of data to help Angelina and the group understand the variables causing pollution in the city. Angelina and Diego have both expressed that they wanted to understand the data they’ve collected better by looking at the middle points of the samples. Since Kiana joined the group, she’s started to brainstorm to see if two variables are related and follow similar patterns. For example, Diego suggested to Kiana to look at the number of cars and their emissions levels. However, Kiana suggests looking at the relationship between the number of sidewalks or bike lanes and whether there is a relationship with pollution levels. Kiana wonders if there are other variables to consider that could cause the pollution levels to be low, in addition to the sidewalks and bike lanes.\n"

The strong correlation between CO2 Emissions and Noise Level implies that these two variables are closely related and may be driven by similar factors.
